Description:

A currency converter is a tool or service that helps you convert the value of one currency into another. It's commonly used for international travel, online shopping, or financial transactions involving different currencies. Currency converters take the current exchange rate between two currencies and allow you to input an amount in one currency, then instantly show you the equivalent amount in the other currency. This helps people understand and compare the value of money in different parts of the world.
